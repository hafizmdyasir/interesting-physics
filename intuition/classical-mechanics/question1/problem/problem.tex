\subsection{Does it stop?}
Consider ideal conditions\footnote{No wind resistance, every shape is geometrically perfect to within precision limited by nature.} in which there is a hard ball rolling without slipping on a floor with friction. This floor is infinite in extent, and there is a gravitational force pulling the ball to the ground at constant magnitude, does the ball ever stop? or does it roll forever?\\
