# interesting-physics
This contains the source code for the Book of Interesting Physics. Check out intuition_qs_only.pdf for a taste.


# The Goal
There exists a large body of physics literature, both text books and 
popular accounts, however in popular accounts there are often no problems,
or when they are presented are worked out, while in text books there 
are too many problems that stress arithmetic and remembering the formulas
rather than illustrating fundamental concepts and solidifying intuition.
We wish to make a collection of these problems.

However, there are also just fun problems as well as interesting ones that
don't quite contribute to intuition but illustrate the scales of things,
for example, precisely how much energy the sun produces compared to how much
we consume, or how light radiation pressure is compared to the weight of a 
feather.

Beyond that, we can make a third section, beyond the intuition building, and 
the interesting problems, for problems that are computationally intensive 
and show the limits of analytical solutions in physics. For each of these we'll
have a folder

/intuition/

/interesting/

/intensive/



# Folder Convention

In each folder will be folders dictating the subject, with subfolders for each question,
in these folders there is a folder for all the appropriate files that a question.tex requires
as well as a solutions folder. For an example check out

/intuition/classical-mechanics/question1/

Note that classical-mechanics is spelled out, our compiler will use the folder name as the section that the problem will fall under.

# Submitting your question

To submit a question you can either send me the question via someway, or use git and help me out by doing it yourself. All it takes is forking the git (there's a button in the upper right hand corner), and then making folders (for example 'question3' in intuiton/classical-mechanics/) and submitting a pull request.


# To-Do

Make the answer.py, both.py, everything.py scripts.
