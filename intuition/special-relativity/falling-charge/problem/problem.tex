\subsection{Falling Charges}
	You are holding a block of charge and then jump off of the top floor of an apartment building.
	You're friend is in the one of the floors and sees an accelerating charge and presumably radiation.
	However, in you're frame, you feel completely inertial so the charges in your arms can't possibly be
	radiating! Does the charge radiate or not?
